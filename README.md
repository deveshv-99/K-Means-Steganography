# K-Means-Steganography

Project made the combined use of Steganography and Cryptography for secure data transmission.
K-Means algorithm was used in selective portions of data to calculate approximate mean centers.
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm was used for encrypting and decrypting the data.

Was run on a local machine.
